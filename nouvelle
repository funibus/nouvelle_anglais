Bart Hibitew

The clock rings in front of me. Three o'clock. The hands never stop, they run tirelessly around the face. And yet, it seems to me that the time stopped. How long have I been here ? I cannot say, some weeks, some months maybe. And during all this time I have had nothing to do, except looking at this clock. But I have lost track of time. Here, the sun can shine at night and the days can be so dark that I can hardly see the clock. One can never know whether it is the day or the night, the only hint is the clock, but it may be broken, there is no way to be sure. I used to have a beautiful watch from my grand father, but of course they took it away from me when I arrived here. Quarter past three. Is it three am or three pm ? How strange it is not to be able to know the hour when you used to care so much about time. And I had always been on time, except one day, that day when everything changed.

My name is Bart Hibitew. I lived in a pretty house near London, with all the comfort I needed. I had a great garden, with a vegetable garden where I grew tomatoes, radish and carrots. I loved to spend my time off cultivating these vegetables and then cooking them, they were delicious. The house also had a lovely living room with a fireplace, where I liked to spend my winter evenings, reading quietly, as I had no wife or children to bother me.

And now here I am, in this cold empty cell, looking at the clock through the bars. And I do not have fresh vegetable to eat anymore. Usually they come once a day, with some food they just get out of the can. It does not look like or taste like food, it is just some kind of mash made with all the things that nobody wants to eat. And they bring me that when they whenever they think of it. It can be the morning or the evening they do not care, as long as I a not dying of starvation. What have I do to deserve that ?

Each morning I would wake up at 6 o'clock. I had some kind of internal clock which would wake me up always at the right time. Then I would have a good breakfast to be in shape all the day, and I would leave my house after a short glance throught the looking glass to be sure that I was fit to be seen. I worked as a chamberlain for an honourable family. They were of some royal line, and had a lot of servant who were under my command. I was very proud of my job and I did it very seriously. I think that is why I managed to keep this job so long while the master's wife was not used to keep a chamberlain more than a few weeks. They had a beautiful house with many rooms and a huge garden where the mistress of the house would organize parties when her husband was working. She had no true friends, but her name attracted all the aspiring people of the region, who were quite numerous. They used to have tea in the living room during winter, and to play croquet in the garden when the summer came.

How long have it been since I saw the sun for the last time ? The first days when I was here, they allowed me to go out of my cell once a day. For ten or fifteen minutes, I could enjoy the sight of the sun and the fresh air of the wind. But weeks after weeks the walks became sparse and now I am not sure of being able to remember what the sun looks like or what the wind feels like. Why am I here ? I have never hurt anybody. I would not be able to hurt someone even if I wanted so, I am far to small and light. And I have always had a behaviour beyond reproach, so why did they imprisoned me ? I have already spend weeks there and I don't know how many I will have to spend again, looking at this clock. I think I would have prefered to be off with my head instead of being in that cell, with that clock and all my questions without answer. Nobody never comes visiting me and I spend my days alone with my thoughts, trying to find when things began to go wrong.

Maybe I should have seen this hapening. I had never been late in my whole life, my internal clock had always waken me on time, except that day. I should have seen it as a warning, but I was so upset of being late -the first time in my life- that I didn't take it into account. I jumped out of my bed, put on the first clothes I found, caught my jacket and I ran in the street, without taking the time to look at my appearance in the mirror.
