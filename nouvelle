The clock rings in front of me. Three o'clock. The hands never stop, they run tirelessly around the face. And yet, it seems to me that the time stopped. How long have I been here ? I cannot say, some weeks, some months maybe. And during all this time I have had nothing to do, except looking at this clock. But I have lost track of time. Here, the sun can shine at night and the days can be so dark that I can hardly see the clock. One can never know whether it is the day or the night, the only hint is the clock, but it may be broken, there is no way to be sure. I used to have a beautiful watch from my grand father, but of course they took it away from me when I arrived here. Quarter past three. Is it three am or three pm ? How strange it is not to be able to know the hour when you used to care so much about time. And I had always been on time, except one day, that day when everything changed.
