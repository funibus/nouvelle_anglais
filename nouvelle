Bart Hibitew

The clock rings in front of me. Three o'clock. The hands never stop, they run tirelessly around the face. And yet, it seems to me that the time stopped. How long have I been here ? I cannot say, some weeks, some months maybe. And during all this time I have had nothing to do, except looking at this clock. But I have lost track of time. Here, the sun can shine at night and the days can be so dark that I can hardly see the clock. One can never know whether it is the day or the night, the only hint is the clock, but it may be broken, there is no way to be sure. I used to have a beautiful watch from my grand father, but of course they took it away from me when I arrived here. Quarter past three. Is it three am or three pm ? How strange it is not to be able to know the hour when you used to care so much about time. And I had always been on time, except one day, that day when everything changed.

My name is Bart Hibitew. I lived in a pretty house near London, with all the comfort I needed. I had a great garden, with a vegetable garden where I grew tomatoes, radish and carrots. I loved to spend my time off cultivating these vegetables and then cooking them, they were delicious. The house also had a lovely living room with a fireplace, where I liked to spend my winter evenings, reading quietle, as I had no wife or children to bother me.

And now here I am, in this empty cell, looking at the clock through the bars. And I do not have fresh vegetable to eat anymore. Usually they come once a day, with some food they just get out of the can. It does not look like or taste like food, it is just some kind of mash made with all that nobody wants to eat. And they bring me that when they remind that I have to eat. It can be the morning or the evening they do not care, as long as I a not dying of starvation. What have I do to deserve that ?

Each morning I would wake up at 6 o'clock. I had some kind of internal clock which would wake me up always at the right time. Then I would have a good breakfast to be in shape all the day, and I would leave my house after a short glance throught the looking glass to be sure that I was fit to be seen. I worked as a chamberlain for an honourable family. They were of some royal line, and had a lot of servant who were under my command. I was very proud of my job and I did it very seriously. I think that is why I managed to keep this job so long while the master's wife was not used to keeping a chamberlain more than a few weeks.
