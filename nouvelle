Bart Hibitew

The clock rings in front of me. Three o'clock. The hands never stop, they run tirelessly around the face. And yet, it seems to me that the time stopped. How long have I been here ? I cannot say, some weeks, some months maybe. And during all this time I have had nothing to do, except looking at this clock. But I have lost track of time. Here, the sun can shine at night and the days can be so dark that I can hardly see the clock. One can never know whether it is the day or the night, the only hint is the clock, but it may be broken, there is no way to be sure. I used to have a beautiful watch from my grand father, but of course they took it away from me when I arrived here. Quarter past three. Is it three am or three pm ? How strange it is not to be able to know the hour when you used to care so much about time. And I had always been on time, except one day, that day when everything changed.

My name is Bart Hibitew. I lived in a pretty house near London, with all the comfort I needed. I had a great garden, with a vegetable garden where I grew tomatoes, radish and carrots. I loved to spend my time off cultivating these vegetables and then cooking them, they were delicious. The house also had a lovely living room with a fireplace, where I liked to spend my winter evenings, reading quietly, as I had no wife or children to bother me.

And now here I am, in this cold empty cell, looking at the clock through the bars. And I do not have fresh vegetable to eat anymore. Usually they come once a day, with some food they just get out of the can. It does not look like or taste like food, it is just some kind of mash made with all the things that nobody wants to eat. And they bring me that when they whenever they think of it. It can be the morning or the evening they do not care, as long as I a not dying of starvation. What have I do to deserve that ?

Each morning I would wake up at 6 o'clock. I had some kind of internal clock which would wake me up always at the right time. Then I would have a good breakfast to be in shape all the day, and I would leave my house after a short glance throught the looking glass to be sure that I was fit to be seen. I worked as a chamberlain for an honourable family. They were of some royal line, and had a lot of servant who were under my command. I was very proud of my job and I did it very seriously. I think that is why I managed to keep this job so long while the master's wife was not used to keep a chamberlain more than a few weeks. They had a beautiful house with many rooms and a huge garden where the mistress of the house would organize parties when her husband was working. She had no true friends, but her name attracted all the aspiring people of the region, who were quite numerous. They used to have tea in the living room during winter, and to play croquet in the garden when the summer came.

How long have it been since I saw the sun for the last time ? The first days when I was here, they allowed me to go out of my cell once a day. For ten or fifteen minutes, I could enjoy the sight of the sun and the fresh air of the wind. But weeks after weeks the walks became sparse and now I am not sure of being able to remember what the sun looks like or what the wind feels like. Why am I here ? I have never hurt anybody. I would not be able to hurt someone even if I wanted so, I am far to small and light. And I have always had a behaviour beyond reproach, so why did they imprisoned me ? I have already spend weeks there and I don't know how many I will have to spend again, looking at this clock. I think I would have prefered to be off with my head instead of being in that cell, with that clock and all my questions without answer. Nobody never comes visiting me and I spend my days alone with my thoughts, trying to find when things began to go wrong.

Maybe I should have seen this hapening. I had never been late in my whole life, my internal clock had always waken me on time, except that day. I should have seen it as a warning, but I was really in a stew -the first time of my life I was overdue- that I didn't take it into account. I jumped out of my bed, put on the first clothes I found, caught my jacket and I ran in the street, without taking the time to look at my appearance in the mirror. Happily, the master was already gone when I arrived and hit wife was still sleeping, so nobody noticed my lateness except the cat. It was just a cat, it couldn't say anything to anybody, but I can swear it had an expression like a grin when it saw me sweating in my jacket, trying to catch my breath. I know it was not rational thought but this cat had always frightened me and I was worried it could find a way to tell his mistress about my lateness.

At leats here I am safe from its claws. The clock rings, four o'clock. I have not looked at the clock for the past three quarters, that is a feat. But the only thing that can make me forgetting about the clock is thinking about what happened, and now I am left with all my questions. How long will I be keeped here ? Why am I here ? Why do they keep me alone ? I am not dangerous, though I am suffering from loneliness. Sometimes when there were too many people making a lot of noise, I was thinking of moving away, living alone in a quiete place, but I have change my mind. Please, let me see someone, I a tired of having this clock for only companion. At least give me my grand father's watch back.

In fact this may have be the first signal. The day before, my watch broke down. As I have already said, it was a beautiful watch I got from my grandfather and I cared a lot about it. I had a neighbourg who was once watchmaker - he was now retired and had a crazy passion for hats - so I immediately brought him my watch. I had to bear for all his chatter when he was working but at least he succeeded to fix it. There were not more than two hours between the time when I noticed my watch was broken and the time when I was back in my house with my watch fixed, so this event did not really worry me. I should have been on guard, but I just spend my evening quietly, as I always do. Maybe I didn't want to see it - the broken watch, the lateness. I had always have a quiet life and I didn't want it to change.

There was a girl, she used to bring me my meal at the begining, but now it almost always the man who bring it to me. He is the only persone I see of the whole day. Henry Liddell, an impressive man with a small moustache. Always with a jacket, like I used to be. He is not a bad man but he never talks to me. He just puts my meal on the floor and goes back, without speaking or even looking at me. It is like if I wasn't there. But if I wasn't there you would not bring food so please, look at me. I am tired of being alone even when you are there. There was this girl, I liked her. Of course it is because of her I am here, so I hated her during the first days, but now I like her -maybe it is the Stockholm syndrom. There was at least one thing that made me like her : she has been the only one talking to me since I am emprisoned. The two others act like if I was not there and this makes me feel very lonely and despaired. But she talked to me. It was just a few minutes per day, but during this time I felt alive again. She was not always nice to me, sometimes she called me with ridiculous names, or she reprimanded me, but at least she was acting like if I was alive. These few minutes really were the best moments of my days. I spent 23 hours and 55 minutes a day, looking at the clock, waiting for her. But it has been a long time since I saw her. I think she end up being bored by me. Maybe she thought I would answer her. I tried but I did not manage to speak here, I can only think. I am doomed to be my only interlocutor here. But that is not a reason to act like if I was not there!
